# format-mac-addresses-excel
A simple visual basic script I didn't write that puts colons into MAC addresses.

## Installation

- Open a spreadsheet with all of your MAC addresses
- Find the range of your MAC addresses, like `A1:A724`
- Open the Visual Basic Editor (on mac it's Tools -> Macro -> Visual Basic Editor)
- Create a new module
- Paste the contents of Script.bas into your module OR download Script.bas, right click on the module folder, Import file, and select Script.bas
- Insert your sheet name where it says to
- Insert your range where it says to
- If you want, you can change the seperators. Just change all of the colons to your chosen separator.
- Press the blue play button towards the top of the Visual Basic Editor
- Done! All of your MAC addresses should be formatted properly.

This code is from a forum post published in the early 2000s. I don't know where I found it, but if you know, I'd love to know.

## Support
I don't even know how it works.
